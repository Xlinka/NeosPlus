# Neos Plus Plugin Installation

**Important:** Neos Plus is a plugin, not a mod. Installation differs between the two.

Follow these steps to install the Neos Plus plugin:

1. Download the `NEOSPlus.dll` file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Xlinka/NeosPlus/releases).
2. Place the downloaded `NEOSPlus.dll` file in the `Libraries` folder in your Neos directory.
3. To make Neos load the plugin, use the `-LoadAssembly` launch argument followed by the plugin's file path: `-LoadAssembly Libraries/NEOSPlus.dll`.

After completing these steps, start Neos. Neos Plus should now be loaded and functional. Check your logs for additional details.

# 설치방법
중요: 네오스 플러스는 모드가 아닌 플러그인 입니다. 이 두가지는 서로 설치 방법이 다름을 인지하여 주세요.
먼저 Releases 탭에서 NEOSPlus.dll 파일을 다운로드 받아 네오스가 설치된 경로아래에 있는 Libraries 폴더에 넣어주세요.
다음으로, 네오스에서 이를 읽어오도록 실행 옵션에 -LoadAssembly를 추가하셔야 합니다.
이렇게 해두면 네오스 실행시 자동으로 읽어들이게 됩니다.
